						<p>As a tech lead responsible for redesigning a complex trade environment into a private cloud. Focus on designing an environment that is future-proof. In addition to fully automating the entire environment (both Windows and Linux systems with terraform and chef) this also means a re-evaluation of certain applications and more towards a SaaS vs PaaS vs IaaS design working where possible. Responsible for design, development and management (plus transfer) of a microservice platform based on Mesosphere/Docker. The design also included building and automated publishing of the relevant APIs and services. Through API managers these APIs were published, service discovery was also an essential component here as the developers do not have to take into account the availability and location of the underlying services (database, APIs, etc). Based on the microservice platform several projects rotated and designed to develop a real-time and reactive platform that provides for automatic forecasting, trading and control of energy power plants (virtual and physical). I was mainly involved in integrating everything and supporting the developers in building microservices (think 12 factor design for example). Responsible for designing, developing and integrating a big data platform based on Hortonworks Hadoop distribution. This platform was built in its entireity in AWS EC2. The platform is mainly used for machine learning for the trade organization. This platform was combined with the microservice platform to build a real-time streaming application based on machine learning. Data interfaces were also built from various sources (MSSQL, Oracle, Bloomberg, Trayport etc). Partly responsible for a change of application interfacing to become cloud ready. Almost all applications have a file interface to share data among themselves. Several CIFS shares were used. However, this was an untenable situation as there was no longer any control over all interfaces, creating an unclear landscape with all the consequences that entails (security, stability, auditing and scalability). In order to bring the (legacy) landscape to the cloud, this had to change. For this we have built a, based on WSO2, ESB that sends all the data, this created clarity and in the future it becomes easier to change legacy applications as all interfacing is immediately clear.</p>

Mainly responsible for the technical design and development of this. Also a design made for making the storage available as high as possible based on various Netapp filers icm an HP EVA 9000 SAN solution. Also started a migration project to migrate the data from the HP EVA to the Netapps. Responsible for the development of an API client for the Netapp filers so that management could be better automated and possibly a service portal could be created. However, this was stopped centrally from vtsPN as only storage specialists were allowed to deal with storage. However, the API client was created and later further thought through at Netapp itself.</p>

		<p>So you can leave a message or something, you don&rsquo;t have to, you can just look at it or click submit very often so I get a lot of empty messages&hellip; Oh, no, you&rsquo;re going to have to fill the form first.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t respond, it&rsquo;s just all broken.</p>
<p>You can also call to <strong>06-22576494</strong>, I eat quite often though and I&rsquo;ve learned not to talk with a full mouth, so you can also text&hellip;or use whatsapp or whatever rocks your boat.</p>
