      <description>*Keep in mind, everything is translated with Bing* So I&amp;rsquo;m Karsten Meinster doing some things in IT mainly in terms of infrastructure and platforms. Especially busy in the field of container platforms (formerly things like Mesos and LXC now really Kubernetes) and especially things around it. These include deployment pipelines, monitoring environments, integration with additional things such as identity management, distributed systems, you name it.
In the past a lot has been spent on migration projects, platform innovations and of course just software management.</description>
